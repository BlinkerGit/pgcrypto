0.0.3
	* Fixed a join bug on SELECT statements

0.0.2
	* Fixed a number of key-related bugs discovered in testing with our
		second production app with encrypted columns. Also duck-typed AREL
		statement types in a few places.

0.0.1
	* INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE statements are working. But I wrote this
	  while testing with a production app, and thus haven't written
    specific tests, so don't get your panties in a twist.
