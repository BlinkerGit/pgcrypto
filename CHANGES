0.1.1
  * Rebuilt the WHERE clause stuff to make sure finders AND setters
    both worked. It's fragile and hackish at this time, but we'll get
    there, folks!

0.1.0
	* Overhauled the underpinnings to rely on a separate column. Adds
	  on-demand loading of encrypted attributes from a central table
	  which provides dramatic speed improvements when a record's
	  encrypted attributes aren't needed most of the time.

0.0.4
	* Compatibility fix between ActiveRecord 3.2.1 and 3.2.2

0.0.3
	* Fixed a join bug on SELECT statements

0.0.2
  * Fixed a number of key-related bugs discovered in testing with our
    second production app with encrypted columns. Also duck-typed AREL
    statement types in a few places.

0.0.1
  * INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE statements are working. But I wrote this
    while testing with a production app, and thus haven't written
    specific tests, so don't get your panties in a twist.
